# Analyzing_Chichago_Socioeconomic_situations

# Chicago Data Analysis Portfolio Project

Welcome to my Chicago Data Analysis Project! In this project, I explored and analyzed two essential datasets: Chicago's socioeconomic indicators and crime records. Through a combination of SQL queries and data visualizations, I aimed to gain insights into the complex relationships between socioeconomic factors and crime rates in different community areas of Chicago.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used a Jupyter notebook to perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Extraction and Transformation**:

   - Leveraged SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from the provided datasets.
   - Prepared the data for analysis by cleaning, aggregating, and joining tables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:

   - Analyzed Chicago's socioeconomic indicators, including per capita income, hardship index, poverty rates, and more.
   - Investigated crime data to understand crime types, their frequency, and trends over the years.

3. **Data Visualization**:

   - Created a variety of data visualizations to represent the datasets effectively.
   - Visualizations included histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, and line charts.

4. **Integration of Socioeconomic and Crime Data**:

   - Explored potential correlations between socioeconomic indicators and crime rates using a heatmap.
   - Combined data analysis techniques to gain comprehensive insights into the dataset.

5. **Conclusion and Insights**:
   - Summarized the key findings and insights from the project.
   - Demonstrated the power of data analysis and visualization in informing policy decisions and community initiatives.

## Project Files

- `portfolio_project.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for this project.
- `ChicagoCensusData.csv`: The dataset for Chicago's socioeconomic indicators.
- `ChicagoCrimeData.csv`: The dataset for reported crime incidents in Chicago.
- `socioeconomic.db`: The SQLite database containing the data after data loading.

## How to Use

You can explore the project by opening the Jupyter notebook, `portfolio_project.ipynb`, which contains detailed explanations, SQL queries, and visualizations. The code is well-documented to help you follow the analysis process.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter notebook, you'll need the following software and libraries:

- Python (recommended version: 3.7+)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SQLite

## Acknowledgments

I want to acknowledge the Chicago Data Portal for providing the datasets used in this project, which allowed me to explore and analyze real-world data. This project was completed as part of my data analysis portfolio.
